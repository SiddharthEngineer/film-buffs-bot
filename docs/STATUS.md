# Status (as of 2026-11-11)

## Done and live

### Phase 0: connection ✅
- Discord app "Film Buffs Bot" (Film Buffs Bot#4646) is in the Film Buffs server with exactly the 13 permissions in the README, no Administrator.
- Role order: `Moderator` (the owner's admin role) above the bot's role, above `@everyone`.
- Server is **not** a Community server; nothing so far needs it (forums work without it).
- `.env` on the VPS holds the token, guild ID and TMDB key (chmod 600, gitignored).

### Phase 1: server layout ✅
Built by `setup_server.py --apply` from `server.yaml`; a fresh `--plan` reports no changes.

```
📢 Info       #welcome-and-rules (read-only, bot-maintained welcome + rules embed)
              #announcements (read-only)
💬 Chat       #general (the server's original channel, adopted), #trailers-and-news
🎬 Movies     #movies (forum; only the bot creates posts, everyone can reply)
📅 Planning   #watch-planning, #watch-log (read-only), #letterboxd-feed (read-only)
🔊 Voice      Watch Party, Discussions (the original voice channels, adopted + renamed)
🔧 Admin      #bot-logs (hidden from @everyone; Moderator sees it as admin)
```

- The original `#games`, `#music` and the default "Text Channels"/"Voice Channels" categories were deleted via the `retire:` list (they were empty).
- `#movies` tags (19 of 20): status tags, all moderated (only the bot applies them): Backlog, Up Next, Watched, Watched (solo), Post-watch (was Spoilers), In Theaters, Streaming. Genre tags: Action, Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Fantasy, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller (mapping from TMDB genres is in `server.yaml`).
- Forum default sort: latest activity. Guidelines text explains `/addmovie`, 👍 voting and the spoiler discussions.

### Phase 2: `/addmovie` ✅ (user-tested)
- TMDB autocomplete shows `Title (Year) — Director`; choice values are `tmdb:<id>` so a typed numeric title like "1917" is never read as an ID. Pasted TMDB movie URLs are also accepted. Anything else is rejected ephemerally and no post is created.
- Duplicate → ephemeral link to the existing post. Posts deleted by hand are forgotten, and the next `/addmovie` recreates them.
- Post: title `Title (Year)`, embed with poster thumbnail, year, runtime, director(s), genres, synopsis, TMDB + Letterboxd links (`https://letterboxd.com/tmdb/<id>`, confirmed working in a browser), added by, pitch. Tags: Backlog + up to `max_genre_tags` (3) genre tags. The bot adds 👍 (the backlog vote).
- Autocomplete answers in ~0.3–0.5 s (Discord's limit is 3 s).

### Ops already in place
- systemd unit `film-buffs-bot` (enabled, `Restart=on-failure`, runs as `dev`, `ProtectSystem=strict` with write access only to `data/` and `backups/`).
- Commands are synced to the guild only (instant updates).
- 25 unit tests passing (`tests/`).

## Phase 3R: spoiler companion posts ✅ (live, owner-tested)
Code and tests are done (25 tests pass). The old spoiler line is retired: its cog was switched off first, and `filmbuffs/spoilers.py` + `filmbuffs/cogs/spoilers.py` were rewritten.
Deployed 2026-11-11. Live-tested from a script on a throwaway post (since deleted): button custom_id, lazy creation, back-link, card → link button, Backlog + Post-watch tags, reuse on second open, and the webhook move with the original deleted. Parasite's card was refreshed (button added, "Spoiler line" field gone, tags Backlog + genres).

- `server.yaml`: new forum `#movie-spoilers` (same permissions as `#movies`); the `spoilers` tag is renamed **🍿 Post-watch** (key and ID unchanged) and means "has a spoiler discussion"; `#movies` guidelines and the welcome message describe the new flow. Applied by the owner; `--plan` reports no changes.
- Info card gets a **🔓 Spoiler discussion** button (`filmbuffs/cards.py`, a persistent `DynamicItem`, `spoilers:<tmdb_id>`). The first click creates "Title (Year) — Spoilers" in `#movie-spoilers` (starter links back, no 👍), adds Post-watch, and turns the button into a link button. A per-movie lock means concurrent clicks create one post. Spoiler posts deleted by hand are forgotten and recreated on the next click.
- `/spoiler`: ephemeral link to the movie's spoiler post (creates it). Inside a spoiler post it links back to `#movies`.
- **Mark as spoiler** (anyone, in `#movies` posts): re-sends the message in the spoiler post via the "Film Buffs spoiler moves" webhook (on `#movie-spoilers`) as the author, with "↪ replying to" and "moved from the spoiler-free post by @X" lines, attachments re-uploaded; then deletes the original. Nothing is posted in `#movies`. If any send or the delete fails, the copies are deleted and the original stays.
- Migration 2: `spoiler_thread_id`, `spoiler_starter_message_id`, `card_version`; it clears the old spoiler-line columns and the `spoilers` flag (Parasite). On startup the bot refreshes old info cards once (adds the button, drops the "Spoiler line" field, retags).
- The bot no longer requests the Message Content intent.

## Known state / cleanup
- The old webhook "Film Buffs reposts" on `#movies` is unused now. It's harmless; delete it in Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks if you like (the bot won't delete it without asking).
- `data/filmbuffs.db` is not backed up yet (nightly backup is Phase 7). It holds the setup-script state (key → Discord ID) as well as movies; losing it means `setup_server.py` would no longer recognize the channels it manages.
